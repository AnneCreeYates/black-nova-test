**Alexis Prior Nutrition Homepage Project**

Welcome to my project! This is a test sample of a homepage that I created entirely from scratch.

**Navigation**

I implemented the navigation using JavaScript. The links in the navigation bar are functional, but they donâ€™t lead anywhere as this is just a first page test.

**Layout and Design**

I designed the layout and overall look of the page using CSS Grid and Flexbox. The page is fully responsive and I made sure to keep accessibility in mind while designing it.

**Content**

In addition to providing basic information about nutrition, the page also features a custom-built contact form.

**Technologies Used**

HTML: I used HTML to structure the content of the web page.
CSS: I used CSS to style the web page and make it visually appealing. I also used Grid and Flexbox to layout the elements on the page.
JavaScript: I used JavaScript to add interactivity to the web page and implement the navigation.
