      <p>Midlife and perimenopausal hormonal changes can knock us for six. They can leave us feeling exhausted, de-motivated, overwhelmed, and worried about our health and how we’re ageing.</p>
      <p>Many of us know we need to make fundamental changes, but we struggle to actually do it. Sometimes this is due to a lack of knowledge. Sometimes it’s because we need to change long-held habits that no longer serve us. Sometimes, we’re overwhelmed, stressed out and confused about where to start. Especially if our hormones are all over the place.</p>

        <li>I give you the knowledge you need to change your health for good </li>
        <li>I help you implement the changes that are relevant for you, whether you have a diagnosed health condition that needs support, or whether you simply want to focus on healthy ageing. There’s no point in just knowing what to do, you need to do it too.</li>
        <li>I cut out the overwhelm by working with you step-by-step and simplifying complex topics</li>
        <li>I help you stay accountable to yourself and deal with any self-sabotage as it crops up</li>
        <li>I help you identify and tackle any unhelpful habits or long-held beliefs around food</li>
        <li>Where needed I’ll help you explore your food story, particularly where this relationship feels uncertain or strained. You’ll find your relationship with food changing and improving</li>
        <li>I make the process enjoyable. I don’t advocate restrictive diets or dogma. Looking after your health should feel great and exciting. It should always make good sense to you, and you should always feel better for it</li>
        <li>You’ll feel more confident about your nutrition, health, and body, by working on your health mindset</li>
        <li>It goes without saying that as a BANT and CNHC Registered Nutritional Therapist, all my recommendations are evidence-based and experience-based from over a decade of clinical practice</li>
