        <p>Midlife and perimenopausal hormonal changes can knock us for six. They can leave us feeling exhausted, de-motivated, overwhelmed, and worried about our health and how we’re ageing.</p>
        <p>Many of us know we need to make fundamental changes, but we struggle to actually do it. Sometimes this is due to a lack of knowledge. Sometimes it’s because we need to change long-held habits that no longer serve us. Sometimes, we’re overwhelmed, stressed out and confused about where to start. Especially if our hormones are all over the place.</p>

          <li><i class="fa-solid fa-seedling"></i> Where needed I’ll help you explore your food story, particularly where this relationship feels uncertain or strained. You’ll find your relationship with food changing and improving</li>
          <li><i class="fa-solid fa-seedling"></i> I make the process enjoyable. I don’t advocate restrictive diets or dogma. Looking after your health should feel great and exciting. It should always make good sense to you, and you should always feel better for it</li>
